# :memo: Project description :

✅ Single Page Portflio Website project created with love using HTML5 SCSS JavaScript and PHP to serve content in deffirent lanuges.

### My reason for choosing to work on this project is to try to focuse on PHP as i already built this project initially in a single lanuage


* i'm still trying to figure out how to make this SAP SEO 🎯 friendly as i learn that this is a big challenge wit SPA.

:monocle_face: you can have a preview a copy from here 👉 **[SPA Portfolio](https://hass-1.github.io/SPA/)**

>
>  🙃 The Preview copy dosn't have the multiling option, as github pages dosn't support dynamique contente.
> I will find a hosting solution once i have it all done. 😅

 :warning: **Warning:** This project is not finished and i will make some updates as my learning progress. :rocket:
